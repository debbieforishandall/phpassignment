# Notes
- My Kali linux virtual machine was having trouble connecting to the internet leading to me developing in windows initally.
- In windows, a lot of time was spent debugging an issue with connecting to github because the ssh key had my old github username. Thus development times may have looked delayed here.
- To circumvent issue above, I used file upload to commit files initially.
